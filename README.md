Cardano
=======

Introduction
------------

This software is a Javascript library to create 3D client applications mainly oriented towards visualization of urban areas, and geospatial analysis and business intelligence dataviz.

It is based on WebGL and Three.js, and is intended to fit well into OpenSource GIS stacks.

It is a work from Oslandia's team and is still under heavy development. Consider this *alpha work*.

If you are interested, we are open to collaboration and contribution. Please get in touch.

About Cardano
-------------

Girolamo Cardano was an Italian mathematician and scientist of the Renaissance period. He was one of the first Europeans to study Matrix algebra, when in 1545 he published Ars Magna, bringing methods to Europe that involved array computations and determinants. And 3D computer science is full of matrices.

Howto start
-----------

There are a bunch of examples available in the *examples* directory.

These rely on some server-side components, which have to be setup before being able to use them. See the INSTALL.md file for more information on installation.

You can also check the FOSS4G 2014 workshop by Oslandia to have a quick grip on these technologies.
